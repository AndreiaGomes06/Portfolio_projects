# Docker - demo app

The idea behind this project was to strengthen knowledge in Docker. For this purpose, a simple application developed in html and Node.js was used, and MongoDB was employed for data storage. All documents are Docker-based. It is possible to use the app by resorting to Docker or using Docker Compose, by creating a YAML document for this purpose. Finally, a Docker image was also generated based on the Dockerfile document.

# With Docker Compose

Step 1: Initiate mongodb and mongo-express
``` docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up ```
