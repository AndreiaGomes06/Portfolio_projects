# Snakebnb

This project aims to simplify the booking process similar to Airbnb, but for snakes, hence the name Snakebnb. The idea is to allow snake owners to reserve cages for their snakes when they travel.

Developed in Python, this project utilizes MongoDB, through mongoengine ODM, as the database to store the entered information. The intention behind this project was to deepen the understanding of handling non-relational databases like MongoDB.
